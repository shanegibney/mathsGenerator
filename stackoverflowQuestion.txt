Issue with Static Django files on Heroku



I have deployed by Django project as a Heroku app, but can not get the static files to work.

settings.py

   # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
   # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/static-files/

   PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'staticfiles')
   STATIC_URL = 'static/'

   # Extra places for collectstatic to find static files.
   STATICFILES_DIRS = (
       os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'static'),
   )

which is exactly what is recommended at [Django and Static Assets][1]

I have set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to false with,

   $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=0 --app mathsproject

The file system looks like this,

[![enter image description here][2]][2]

which shows that the 'static' directory is in the root of my Django project. But I do not see where the 'staticfiles' directory is? Should this be created somewhere?

When running,

$ heroku logs

I typically get errors showing that the static files are missing. And this is obvious in the browser too.
